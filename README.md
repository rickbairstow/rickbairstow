## Hello, I'm Rick Bairstow ðŸ‘‹

### About Me
I'm a passionate Front End Software Engineer and ðŸ¥· Web Ninja ðŸ¥· with a love for mentoring, teaching, and promoting accessibility within the web. Specialising in front-end development, I create user-friendly web applications using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, VueJS, TailwindCSS, PHP, and more. My focus is on delivering intuitive and engaging user experiences that prioritise user journeys, performance, and readable, clean code.

I actively contribute to the community by organising frontend mentor groups, providing code reviews, engaging in pair programming sessions, and developing frontend training plans. This hands-on involvement allows me to share my expertise and foster growth within the development community.

In addition to my community efforts, I contribute across all aspects of projects, from initial conception and design through to development, rigorous testing, and deployment. By collaborating closely with cross-functional teams, I ensure each project meets client objectives and adheres to industry best practices.

Outside of work, I'm deeply committed to Taekwon-Do ðŸ¥‹ Holding a 1st Degree black belt and serving as an instructor for NEST Taekwon-do, I mentor both adults and children. Teaching and mentoring in Taekwon-Do are not only passions but also integral parts of my life that contribute to my personal development and well-being.

Feel free to connect with me on LinkedIn to stay updated on my professional journey and learn more about my expertise in front-end development and creating user-centric web experiences.
